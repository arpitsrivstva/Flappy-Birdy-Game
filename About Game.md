# Flappy-Birdy-Game
Game name : Flappy Birdy

How-to-Play in 3 steps ~
1. Don't touch the ground! "Blocks" are the obstacles. 
2. Left-clicks cause the bird to fly (kinda) or uplift a bit. Right, helps our Flappy Bird to pass through the obstacles, but only for 5 left-clicks (after that -> istrigger=true;). The "Timer" on the top right will make you count the left-clicks for you. It will reset itself as you hold or release the right-click.
3. You have to collect the "Lights" as much as you can to keep the game visible, yes. You will get it while playing, dont worry.
